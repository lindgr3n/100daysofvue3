# Day 50 - Halfway mark

Here we are 50 days in and 50% done! What have we learned so far?

* Composition API
* Provide/Inject
* Render API
* Refs
* What can be breaking when going from Vue 2
* Functional components

Think that from now on we can try and implement some more. Try and build some small things and see how Render API and Composition API can help us.
The best exercise could be to refactor [Heroes of Vue](https://heroes-of-vue.netlify.app/). Something that i have previous thought about. Thing is i would like to do the component refactor first. Lets see what we do. Could start with the standard Star Wars implementation :)
