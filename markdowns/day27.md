# Day 27 - Who win v-if or v-for

In Vue 2 using `v-for` and `v-if` on the same element v-for took precedence. This have now changed in Vue 3 and now `v-if` take precedence. Using both v-if and v-for on the same element is consider bad practice. Don't think i have found a need to use both on the same element.
