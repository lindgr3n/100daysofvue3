# Day 85 - Typescript API

So our journey continues with building our API to connect with LootLocker. Got a bit stuck with class implementation and did not get a good type definition when using it in my game. One of the issues is my first approach was to use class to set up my api. Thinking if its better to go functional approach.

There we go. Refactored it to use a more functional approach. Kinda inspired by [Unsplash-js](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js/) and how they do it.

Will be fun to see where we can go from here. Can say that Typescript have helped me a bit in structuring the code. Still some parts have made a-lot of searching. Still did not get the typing help i wanted in my consumer application. Tomorrows issue.
