# Day 87 - Loot Locker and composables

Fist i got a bit stuck with CORS. Looks like i get the requests to be passed but i get a CORS error in the log. Will need to lock into that later. Started to refractor the small game i had and move out some logic i made directly in my component to a composable. Lets see how that works out.
