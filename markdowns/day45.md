# Day 45 - Provide / inject

Lets continue where we left of yesterday with [provide/inject](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-provide-inject.html#provide-inject)

Not sure why i haven't been using this before. This would be similar like reacts [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

Think we got a better understanding about it now. So lets get back to the previous example tomorrow.
