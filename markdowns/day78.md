# Day 78 - Back on track

Let's get back to the issue at hand at dive right back into the Composition API on our sandbox implementation.

My approach is to make a composable that can fetch peoples that exist in the Star Wars. First implementation it looks like it gets stuck in a loop and fetching the people over and over.
Think the Sandbox also is playing me. Get some strange errors. Think i need to create a local application to continue on.
