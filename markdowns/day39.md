# Day 39 - What should we do

Think we will dive into the docs and see if we can find something interesting. Not only Vue 3 specific but also something we have not thought about before.

First thing i notice is the `v-once` have some memories about it but have never used it. Do we have any good use case for it?

Next we had some nice example using debounce. Lets refactor it tomorrow to be used for a basic search timeout.
