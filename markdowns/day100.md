# Day 100 - Final day

Will say that i have "failed" this challenge. The last week was hard to get the code flowing.
The focus on Vue in the beginning was good but at around day 60 i started to loose focus and went over to typescript. Did not have any goal and started to be a bit "lost" in the end when trying to get three combination. Combination with work and Christmas holidays made it hard to keep up. Will definitely do this again and make it! The most important part is not to feel forced to do the work but just have fun and keep on doing it.

Happy new years!
