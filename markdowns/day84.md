# Day 84 - LootLocker

If you don't know what it is, I mentioned it yesterday.[LootLocker](https://www.lootlocker.io/) an backend for building games. It can keep track of achievements, maps, inventory etc. So started to play around a bit with its api and how one could integrate it. Also perfect time to implement some of our newly learned Typescript skills. Lets make an node api to connect with LootLocker. Could find any existing that used JavaScript.
