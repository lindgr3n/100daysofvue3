# Day 52 - Composable

So lets make something from the old [StarWars timeline](https://codesandbox.io/s/v60jn2ow63?file=/src/App.vue) i did a while back.
Lets break out the fetch to an api. Then we create a composable that keeps track on the movies.

You can check it out in [Day 52](https://codesandbox.io/s/100daysofvue3-9yql8?file=/src/components/Day52.vue)
