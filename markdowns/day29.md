# Day 29 - v-for refs

Another feature of Vue i have not really gotten into is the use of refs. Don't really get the example they have for [array-refs](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/array-refs.html#frontmatter-title).

Don't get my onUpdate to trigger a console. Also tried on a codesandbox with SFC but no luck.
