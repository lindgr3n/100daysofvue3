# Day 64 - Typescript in Vue

Today nothing got done. Checked some Vetur issues. Got a issue from yesterday from the clean project we created. That vue import could not find its corresponding type declarations.

`Cannot find module 'vue' or its corresponding type declarations.Vetur(2307`

Something to check out more.
