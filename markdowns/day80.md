# Day 80 - Soon out of time

Now we only have 20 days left. Time flies. Will continue the next few days to work with the Composition API and typescript. Will push up the Star Wars repo later when I'm done.
Set up typing for a fetch command. Got a good guide here [fetch-with-async-await-and-typescript](https://www.carlrippon.com/fetch-with-async-await-and-typescript/)

Also managed to set up a model for our Star Wars person. What can we manage to do tomorrow!
