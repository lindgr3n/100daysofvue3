# Day 63 - Vue + Typescript

So here we are, can we get into Vue and Typescript? Started by looking through two courses on [Vue 3 + Typescript](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue3-typescript/why-vue-&-typescript). Nothing out of the ordinary. If you want to get started with Typescript in Vue you just use the typescript preset when creating a new project using `@vue/cli` or if you have an existing project you can use `vue add typescript` and the needed configuration file will be created.
