# Day 86 - Type it type

Continued a bit with the loot-locker api. Think i need to feel the implementation a bit. Like the functional approach but think when looking back in 6 months i will wonder what I did.
Lets continue a bit tomorrow and see if we can back on track and use it together with an Composition API.
