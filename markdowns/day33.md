# Day 33 - Slots unification

In Vue 2 we had different ways to reach the slots. Default slots and scoped slots. In Vue 3 this is no unified and they have removed `scopedSlots`.

Not getting my examples to work. Render function and include another component. Think we need to read up more and get back tomorrow.
