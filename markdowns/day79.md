# Day 79 - Sanity and the infinite loop

Today i got stuck a while with Sanity on how to integrate it with Gatsby. Overall it was going good. A few issue i had, especially with watch mode. My data stopped to work on and off.
Needed to trigger a `ccurl -X POST http://localhost:8000/__refresh` to wake it up again.

Then i did not have much time over for the day so created my sandbox project local to make it a bit smoother.
