# Day 89 - Missing types

Continue playing around with Typescript and annyang. Got issue that typescript did not find types for it. Checking @types we find that annyang exist so `npm install --save-dev @types/annyang` and we are back up. Still got an issue that VSCoded did not find the types for library.

Reloaded the VSCode and now it worked.
