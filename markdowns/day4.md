# Day 4 - Reactive Composition

Yesterday we started to look into the `Composition API`. Now we dig into the `ref` function to make any variable reactive.
Why do we need to do this? This is because we can keep the same behavior across all different data types.

Will need to dig into pass b value and reference because I do not really manage to get my example working as I want.
